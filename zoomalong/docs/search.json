Parameters should be either primitives or unique values Variables should build up your resource names from the parameter primitives. ### Parameters I prefer to inject any unique values via a VSTS/VSO or if your prefer Azure DevOps deployment process.\nIn the first part of the file I spell out the acronyms which form part of the naming convention for the resources, you could use nested templates for this, but I feel the add unnecessary complications, as the nested template must be available via a URL.\nThe second part involves parameters that are specific to this application, such as the tenant id, application name etc.\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#\",\n    \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"para_acronym_region\": { \"value\": \"we\" },\n        \"para_acronym_resgrp\": { \"value\": \"resgrp\" },\n        \"para_acronym_appsvc\": { \"value\": \"appsvc\" },\n        \"para_acronym_svcpln\": { \"value\": \"svcpln\" },\n        \"para_acronym_stract\": { \"value\": \"str\" },\n        \"para_acronym_kv\": { \"value\": \"kv\" },\n        \"para_acronym_azfunc\": { \"value\": \"fn\" },\n        \"para_acronym_appin\": { \"value\": \"appins\" },\n        \"para_acronym_webapp\": { \"value\": \"webapp\" },\n        \"para_ad_tenantid\": { \"value\": \" OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS \" },\n        \"para_application_name\": { \"value\": \" OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS \" },\n        \"para_vanity_name\": { \"value\": \" OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS \" },\n        \"para_target_env\": { \"value\": \"dev\" },\n        \"para_kvSecretsObject\": {\n            \"value\": {\n                \"secrets\": [\n                {\n                    \"secretName\": \"applicationuser\",\n                    \"secretValue\": \"OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"secretName\": \"AnotherSecrect\",\n                    \"secretValue\": \"OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS\"\n                }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nVariables\nAs you can see from the variables, I build up my resource names from the parameters.\nI also pull in values for the hostingplan and component identities, so they can be used easily with the resource definitions.\n\"variables\": {\n    \"var_env_region\": \"[concat(parameters('para_target_env'), '-', parameters('para_acronym_region'))]\",\n    \"var_public_url\": \"[concat(parameters('para_target_env'), '.', parameters('para_application_name'), '.', parameters('para_vanity_name'))]\",\n    \"var_str_name\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), parameters('para_acronym_stract'), parameters('para_target_env'), parameters('para_acronym_region'))]\",\n    \"var_str_resId\": \"[resourceId(resourceGroup().Name,'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', variables('var_str_name'))]\",\n    \"var_kv_name\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), '-', parameters('para_acronym_kv'), '-', variables('var_env_region'))]\",\n    \"var_azf_name\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), '-', parameters('para_acronym_azfunc'),'-', variables('var_env_region'))]\",\n    \"var_appin_name\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), '-', parameters('para_acronym_appin'),'-', variables('var_env_region'))]\",\n    \"var_hstpln_group\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), '-', parameters('para_acronym_resgrp'), '-', variables('var_env_region'))]\",\n    \"var_hstpln_env\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), '-', parameters('para_acronym_appsvc'), '-', variables('var_env_region'))]\",\n    \"var_hstpln_name\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), '-', parameters('para_acronym_svcpln'), '-', variables('var_env_region'))]\",\n    \"var_webapp_name\": \"[concat(parameters('para_application_name'), '-' ,parameters('para_acronym_webapp'),'-', variables('var_env_region'))]\",\n    \"var_webapp_hstpln\": \"[concat('/subscriptions/', subscription().subscriptionId, '/resourceGroups/', variables('var_hstpln_group'), '/providers/Microsoft.Web/serverfarms/', variables('var_hstpln_name'))]\",\n    \"var_msi_azf\": \"[concat(resourceId('Microsoft.Web/sites', variables('var_azf_name')),'/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/Identities/default')]\"\n},"

    "text": "Bootstrapping\nThe trouble with many security policies is that at least some element needs to know the password in order to instigate access to resources. That used to mean putting credentials into a configuration file or inserting them during a deployment process. The Manage Service Identities (MSI) facility has got around this by allowing all your resources to register a service principal with Active Directory, and then each resource grants the desired level of access to that service principal. By doing the security in this way, each of the resources never need to know credentials, they only request access and deal with the response. So, by removing credentials from the equation then there is no need to have to rotate passwords or update certs on a timely basis as they simply don�t exist between the resources.\n\n\nSo how do we accomplish this.\nWithin the azure function arm template declaration insert the following, this will register the function with your active directory.\n\"identity\": {\"type\": \"SystemAssigned\"},\nIn the variables section of the Arm Template, get the identity of the Azure Function. (replace ‘var_azf_name’ with the name of your function)\n\"var_msi_azf\": \"[concat(resourceId('Microsoft.Web/sites', variables('var_azf_name')),'/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/Identities/default')]\"\nWithin your Key Vault template your will need to add the functions access policy\n\"accessPolicies\": [{\"tenantId\": \"[reference(variables('var_msi_azf'), '2015-08-31-PREVIEW').tenantId]\",\"objectId\": \"[reference(variables('var_msi_azf'), '2015-08-31-PREVIEW').principalId]\",\"permissions\": {\"certificates\": [\"get\"],\"keys\": [\"get\"],\"secrets\": [\"get\"]}}}]"

    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to disproportionately impact racial minorities in the United States, exacerbating exiting socioeconomic disparities and increasing vulnerability to morbidity and mortality. This study investigates the long-term impacts systematic disinvestment through historical redlining on COVID-19 mortality outcomes in Atlanta. We employed longitudinal multilevel linear regression models to analyze confirmed cumulative COVID-19 mortality rates per 1,000 people across ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) from March 17, 2020, to December 31, 2022. Our analysis revealed that redlined ZCTAs exhibited significantly higher COVID-19 mortality rates and a steeper increase in cumulative deaths over time. Furthermore, a higher proportion of Black residents in these ZCTAs was strongly associated with increased mortality, even after controlling for redlined status. These findings illustrate the persistent effects of historical segregation on health outcomes and underscore the importance of addressing interconnected socioeconomic factors to enhance health equity in vulnerable communities. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing effective interventions and policies aimed at mitigating disparities in health outcomes."

    "title": "From the Trenches: A Global Survey of Anti-TIP NGOs and their Views of US Efforts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Amid the academic and policy critiques of the United States 15-year push to eliminate human trafficking, the perspective of the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) working with anti-trafficking advocacy and services has been largely ignored. This article presents the results of a global survey of nearly 500 anti-trafficking NGOs in working in 133 countries, and is the first NGO-focused survey of its kind. Based on the results of the survey, we provide an overview of the anti-trafficking NGO sector as a whole, detail the relationship between anti-trafficking NGOs and the US, and account for some of the variation in NGO opinions of US efforts. Notably, we find that NGOs are remarkably satisfied with US-led efforts—despite their acknowledged flaws—and that NGOs believe that American anti-TIP policies are important and, on balance, helpful. These results also provide a warning for the future of the United States’ anti-trafficking advocacy, suggesting that the US avoid politicizing its annual Trafficking in Persons Report."

    "text": "Abstract\nAn increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is especially the case for democracies, which unlike autocracies, may not aggressively attack civic space. We explore if crackdowns on NGOs predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a predictor of political terror, and violations of physical integrity rights and civil liberties. We find that while de jure anti-NGO laws provide little information in predicting future repression, their patterns of implementation—or de facto civil society repression—predicts worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nGovernments across the world have increasingly used laws to restrict the work of nonprofits, which has led to a reduction in public or official foreign aid directed towards these groups. Many international nonprofits, in response, have turned to individual donors to offset the loss of traditional funding. What are individual donors’ preferences regarding donating to legally besieged nonprofits abroad? We conducted a conjoint experiment on a nationally representative sample of likely donors in the US and found that learning about host government criticism and legal restrictions on nonprofits decreases individuals’ preferences to donate to them. However, organizational features such as financial transparency and accountability can protect against this dampening effect. Our results have important implications both for understanding private international philanthropy and how nonprofits can better frame their fundraising appeals at a time when they are facing restrictive civic spaces and hostile governments abroad."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis research note asks whether states issuing pandemic-era human rights treaty derogations implemented emergency provisions as intended or used them to abuse human rights during a time of crisis. In an effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries declared states of emergency and derogated (temporarily suspended) from their international human rights treaty obligations. Using data from the Varieties of Democracy PanDem dataset and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, we find that states that derogated from their international human rights obligations imposed emergency measures that were temporary and did not violate non-derogable rights. On the other hand, states that did not derogate were more likely impose discriminatory measures, enact emergency measures without time limits and violate non-derogable rights. Our results support the role that flexibility mechanisms such as derogations play in international law and show that states are being sincere about their intentions and not, generally, using these mechanisms to cover abusive behavior."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe parameters of a statistical model can sometimes be difficult to interpret substantively, especially when that model includes non-linear components, interactions, or transformations. Analysts who fit such complex models often seek to transform raw parameter estimates into quantities that are easier for domain experts and stakeholders to understand. This article presents a simple conceptual framework to describe a vast array of such quantities of interest, which are reported under imprecise and inconsistent terminology across disciplines: predictions, marginal predictions, marginal means, marginal effects, conditional effects, slopes, contrasts, risk ratios, etc. We introduce {marginaleffects}, a package for R and Python which offers a simple and powerful interface to compute all of those quantities, and to conduct (non-)linear hypothesis and equivalence tests on them. {marginaleffects} is lightweight; extensible; it works well in combination with other R and Python packages; and it supports over 100 classes of models, including Linear, Generalized Linear, Generalized Additive, Mixed Effects, Bayesian, and several machine learning models."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."

    "text": "Abstract\nState restrictions on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have become increasingly pervasive across the globe. While this crackdown has been shown to have a negative impact on public funding flows, we know little about how it impacts private philanthropy. How does information about crackdown abroad, as well as organizational attributes of nonprofits affect individual donors’ willingness to donate internationally? Using a survey experiment, we find that learning about repressive NGO environments increases generosity in that already-likely donors are willing to donate substantially more to legally besieged nonprofits. This generosity persists when mediated by two organizational-level heuristics: NGO issue areas and main funding sources. We discuss the implications of our results on how nonprofits can use different framing appeals to increase fundraising at a time when traditional public donor funding to such organizations is decreasing."

    "text": "Abstract\nDid states misuse international legal emergency provisions during the COVID-19 pandemic to justify human rights abuse or did they follow international human rights law? Many governments restricted citizens’ freedom of movement, association, and assembly during the crisis, raising questions about states’ commitments to international human rights law. Some states used derogations to communicate temporary suspension of international legal provisions in a proportional and non-discriminatory manner, while others did not. We explore the dynamics of democratic backsliding and derogation use during the pandemic. We find that backsliding states were more likely to issue human rights treaty derogations. These derogations had mitigating effects once issued. Backsliding states that issued derogations were more likely to communicate restrictions and were less likely to issue abusive and discriminatory policy during the pandemic. Derogations helped temper abuse in states not experiencing backsliding. However, derogations did not always protect against abuse and media transparency in backsliding states. These results lend support to the use of flexibility mechanisms in international law and find that most states did not use emergency derogations to heighten human rights violations. The study contributes to the understanding of how international legal measures may help mitigate elements of democratic backsliding during times of crisis."

    "text": "Abstract\nA wave of legislative and regulatory crackdown on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) has constricted the legal environment for foreign advocacy groups interested in influencing domestic and global policy. Although the legal space for advocacy is shrinking, many INGOs have continued their work and found creative ways to adapt to these restrictions, sometimes even reshaping the regulatory environments of their target countries in their favor. In this article, I explore what enables INGOs to cope with and reshape their regulatory environments. I bridge international relations and interest group literatures to examine the interaction between INGO resource configurations and institutional arrangements. I argue that specific resource and managerial characteristics provide organizations with ‘programmatic flexibility’ that enables groups to adjust their strategies without changing their core mission. I illustrate and test this argument with case studies of Article 19 and AMERA International and demonstrate how organizations with high programmatic flexibility can navigate regulations and shape policy in their target country, while those without this flexibility are shut out of policy discussions and often the target country itself. I conclude by exploring how the interaction between internal characteristics and institutional environments shape and constrain the effects of interest groups in global governance."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEcological theorists have generated several yet unresolved disputes that try to untangle the difficulty in understanding the nature of complex ecological communities. In this paper, we combine two recent theoretical approaches that used together suggest a promising way to consider how evolutionary and ecological processes may be used to frame a general theory of community ecology and its functional stability. First, we consider the theoretical proposal by Mark Vellend (2016) to focus on a small set of higher-level evolutionary and ecological processes that act on species within an ecological community. These processes provide a basis for ecological theory similar to the way in which theoretical population genetics has focused on a small set of mathematical descriptions to undergird its theory. Second, we explore ideas that might be applied to ecosystem functioning developed by Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Mossio’s (2015) work on how biologically autonomous systems emerge from closure of relevant constraints. To explore the possibility that combining these two ideas may provide a more general theoretical understanding of ecological communities, we have developed a stochastic, agent-based model, with agents representing species, that explores the potential of using evolutionary and ecological processes as a constraint on the flow of species through an ecosystem. We explore how these ideas help illuminate aspects of stability found in many ecological communities. These agent-based modeling results provide in-principle arguments that suggest that constraint closure, using evolutionary and ecological processes, explains general features of ecological communities. In particular, we find that our model suggests a perspective useful in explaining repeated patterns of stability in ecological evenness, species turnover, species richness, and in measures of fitness."

    "text": "Bootstrapping\nThe trouble with many security policies is that at least some element needs to know the password in order to instigate access to resources. That used to mean putting credentials into a configuration file or inserting them during a deployment process. The Manage Service Identities (MSI) facility has got around this by allowing all your resources to register a service principal with Active Directory, and then each resource grants the desired level of access to that service principal. By doing the security in this way, each of the resources never need to know credentials, they only request access and deal with the response. So, by removing credentials from the equation then there is no need to have to rotate passwords or update certs on a timely basis as they simply don�t exist between the resources.\n\n\nSo how do we accomplish this.\nWithin the azure function arm template declaration insert the following, this will register the function with your active directory.\n\"identity\": {\"type\": \"SystemAssigned\"},\nIn the variables section of the Arm Template, get the identity of the Azure Function. (replace ‘var_azf_name’ with the name of your function)\n\"var_msi_azf\": \"[concat(resourceId('Microsoft.Web/sites', variables('var_azf_name')),'/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/Identities/default')]\"\nWithin your Key Vault template your will need to add the functions access policy\n\"accessPolicies\": [{\"tenantId\": \"[reference(variables('var_msi_azf'), '2015-08-31-PREVIEW').tenantId]\",\"objectId\": \"[reference(variables('var_msi_azf'), '2015-08-31-PREVIEW').principalId]\",\"permissions\": {\"certificates\": [\"get\"],\"keys\": [\"get\"],\"secrets\": [\"get\"]}}}]"

The normal method would be to deploy out each individual component to Azure and each would get its own ‘aurewebsites.com’ URL.

In the example below, we are creating a storage account with two containers.\n{\n    \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts\",\n    \"apiVersion\": \"2018-02-01\",\n    \"name\": \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\",\n    \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n    \"tags\": {\n        \"displayName\": \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\"\n    },\n    \"sku\": {\n        \"name\": \"Standard_LRS\"\n    },\n    \"kind\": \"StorageV2\",\n    \"properties\": {},\n    \"resources\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"blobServices/containers\",\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2018-03-01-preview\",\n            \"name\": \"[concat('default/', parameters('Container1Name'))]\",\n            \"dependsOn\": [\n                \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\"\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"publicAccess\": \"Container\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"blobServices/containers\",\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2018-03-01-preview\",\n            \"name\": \"[concat('default/', parameters('Container2Name'))]\",\n            \"dependsOn\": [\n                \"[parameters('StorageAccountName')]\"\n            ],\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"publicAccess\": \"None\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\nWe can then go ahead and deploy this, and see the two containers being created. You can see in the template we are setting different Public Access properties on the two containers, you have a choice of 3 values here: None (private container) Container (the whole container is publically accessible) Blob (only Blobs are publically accessible)\nThe above example is fine, but you need to specify each of the containers as separate parameters, and remember to add the correct number of container clauses to the script.\nSo if we specify the containers as a array in the parameters file\n    \"para_storageObject\": {\n      \"value\": {\n        \"containers\": [\n          {\n            \"containerName\": \"files\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"containerName\": \"elephants\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"containerName\": \"bananas\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\nThen we can use a copy clause to cycle over the array and create our containers in the deploy\n    {\n      \"apiVersion\": \"2018-03-01-preview\",\n      \"copy\": {\n        \"name\": \"containersCopy\",\n        \"count\": \"[length(parameters('para_storageObject').containers)]\"\n      },\n      \"dependsOn\": [\n        \"[concat('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/', variables('var_str_name'))]\"\n      ],\n      \"name\": \"[concat(variables('var_str_name'), '/default/', parameters('para_storageObject').containers[copyIndex()].containerName)]\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"publicAccess\": \"Container\"\n      },\n      \"tags\": {\n        \"displayName\": \"StorageAcct/Containers\"\n      },\n      \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers\"\n    },"

    "text": "Bootstrapping\nThe trouble with many security policies is that at least some element needs to know the password in order to instigate access to resources. That used to mean putting credentials into a configuration file or inserting them during a deployment process. The Manage Service Identities (MSI) facility has got around this by allowing all your resources to register a service principal with Active Directory, and then each resource grants the desired level of access to that service principal. By doing the security in this way, each of the resources never need to know credentials, they only request access and deal with the response. So, by removing credentials from the equation then there is no need to have to rotate passwords or update certs on a timely basis as they simply don�t exist between the resources.\n\n\nSo how do we accomplish this.\nWithin the azure function arm template declaration insert the following, this will register the function with your active directory.\n\"identity\": {\"type\": \"SystemAssigned\"},\nIn the variables section of the Arm Template, get the identity of the Azure Function. (replace ‘var_azf_name’ with the name of your function)\n\"var_msi_azf\": \"[concat(resourceId('Microsoft.Web/sites', variables('var_azf_name')),'/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/Identities/default')]\"\nWithin your Key Vault template your will need to add the functions access policy\n\"accessPolicies\": [{\"tenantId\": \"[reference(variables('var_msi_azf'), '2015-08-31-PREVIEW').tenantId]\",\"objectId\": \"[reference(variables('var_msi_azf'), '2015-08-31-PREVIEW').principalId]\",\"permissions\": {\"certificates\": [\"get\"],\"keys\": [\"get\"],\"secrets\": [\"get\"]}}}]"

The obvious draw back here is, as the code evolves and the secret changes then you would need to update both the parameters plus the deployment script. So first off in the parameters file put the secrets into an array.\n    \"para_kvSecretsObject\": {\n      \"value\": {\n        \"secrets\": [\n          {\n            \"secretName\": \"applicationuser\",\n            \"secretValue\": \"OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"secretName\": \"AnotherSecret\",\n            \"secretValue\": \"OVERWRITTEN BY VSTS\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\nStraight away you can see that the actual secret is injected from the CI tool, this is so you can inject a different secret depending on the environment. Putting the secrets into an array in this way means that we can cycle through the array in the deployment script without actually referring to the secret itself, only using the array index."

Where your class is interfacing with a different system such as being used in a API interface, then you need to convey to the user the maximum amount of information, about what is or isnt valid, so the validation details have to be encoded in the model. Where Data Annotations is lacking, E.g. OneOf, AnyOf, then you should build a custom validator to fill the gap.\nFluent Validation should be used internally, as it not only can apply general validations, it can also encode groups of validations into rules and apply them under different conditions.\n\n\nRef\nThis is a interesting read on validators, and also the implementation of custom validators. https://weblogs.asp.net/ricardoperes/net-8-data-annotations-validation"

    "text": "How to build Cloud components without any Azure Experience\nIt is a bit of a misnomer; you need people with cloud experience.\nSorry I am not going to say anything new here, but it just might be new here.\nIn typical application code is the same no matter what platform you develop on, you have an interface to the world, domain/business rules, and a data interface. Only the interface to the world needs to be managed by someone with more specialised knowledge. You could divide up the code and create two projects, one for the API, specialised to the environment it will be deployed, and one for the domain/business logic. This would enable you to simply wrap the domain/business rules in its own NuGet package and use normal developers to create them and allow them to use tradition tools to build and evaluate them.\n\nThe previous solution would be fine, but it still leaves scope for organically grown code, which encapsulates complex business rules. The build test burden could be reduced further by making the projects even smaller. Reducing their complexity and increasing their automatic testability. In this case the Domain logic could be reduced to encoding process flow only, and business rules evaluation could be managed by a more suitable tool. Also if the data store interface is not specific to this application but a general interface used by many applications, then it also could make use of package management.\n\nThe questions, I keep hearing when there is a proposed change in development strategy, such as • How do we keep up with package versioning • How do we make sure all applications are using the same package versions\nThe simple answer is developers should use good development practices. 1. At the start of any new development, they should a. Run the unit tests b. Get the latest packages c. Run the unit tests d. Fix any issues caused by the updated packages e. Run the unit tests 2. Create new code 3. Create new tests a. Run the unit tests 4. Create a check in note 5. Check in The only project where package version matters is the API project, as that what is presented to the user."

Moving forward with a service-oriented application design, the code should be split along functional lines, where each function becomes a self-contained package which can be reused. Packaging up functionality has been common practice for several years as it promotes * Specialisation, forcing the components to do ‘one thing and one thing only’. * Simpler testing. * Versioning * Ease of upgrade\n\n\n\nConsequences\nThis break up of the monolith is not without its drawbacks, at least in the begining. The usual complaints are :- * Code is being duplicated. * Yes, it will be, until all the relervant functionality has been encapsulated. * Paying again, for no additional functionality. * Yes, we will be, For historical reasons of a lack of control on our part. * Or a philosophy of keep the hopper full and pushing ever forward with business functionality, and forgetting any technical requirements."

HTTP/2 now compresses those headers reducing the package size\n\nMultiplexing\n\nWeb pages can contain 100s of resources, in previous versions of HTTP each resource had to be requested individually in sequential order. With HTTP/2 your requests will be non blocking.\n\nSupported by all major browsers\n\nAll major browsers support HTTP/2, but if your browser doesnt then the protocol will be downgraded to HTTP 1.1\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\ngRPC\n\ngRPC.io\nGoogle gRPC\nMicrosoft gRPC\nYouTube - Blazor\n\nHTTP/2\n\nWikiPedia HTTP/2\nGoogle HTTP/2\nIETF HTTP Working Group\nYouTube - HTTP/2"

This is done by having links point to the invisible scripts and those scripts set off malicious code. The user clicks the link and thinks that the link is broken because nothing appeared to happen, but a script was set off where they couldn’t see it.\nThe thing to remember when including an IFrame on your web page is that your users are only as safe as the content of all the sites you link to. If you have reason to feel a site is untrustworthy, don’t link to it in any fashion and most definitely don’t include its contents in an IFrame.

By using the KeyVault in this way means that the application code doesn’t need to know anything about the environment or its configuration.

    "title": "SAS Storage Account Access",
    "section": "",
    "text": "When you use shared access signatures in your applications, you need to be aware of two potential risks:\n\nIf a SAS is leaked, it can be used by anyone who obtains it, which can potentially compromise your storage account.\nIf a SAS provided to a client application expires and the application is unable to retrieve a new SAS from your service, then the application’s functionality may be hindered.\n\nThe following recommendations for using shared access signatures can help mitigate these risks:\n\nAlways use HTTPS to create or distribute a SAS. If a SAS is passed over HTTP and intercepted, an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack is able to read the SAS and then use it just as the intended user could have, potentially compromising sensitive data or allowing for data corruption by the malicious user.\nReference stored access policies where possible. Stored access policies give you the option to revoke permissions without having to regenerate the storage account keys. Set the expiration on these very far in the future (or infinite) and make sure it’s regularly updated to move it farther into the future.\nUse near-term expiration times on an ad hoc SAS. In this way, even if a SAS is compromised, it’s valid only for a short time. This practice is especially important if you cannot reference a stored access policy. Near-term expiration times also limit the amount of data that can be written to a blob by limiting the time available to upload to it.\nHave clients automatically renew the SAS if necessary. Clients should renew the SAS well before the expiration, in order to allow time for retries if the service providing the SAS is unavailable. If your SAS is meant to be used for a small number of immediate, short-lived operations that are expected to be completed within the expiration period, then this may be unnecessary as the SAS is not expected to be renewed. However, if you have client that is routinely making requests via SAS, then the possibility of expiration comes into play. The key consideration is to balance the need for the SAS to be short-lived (as previously stated) with the need to ensure that the client is requesting renewal early enough (to avoid disruption due to the SAS expiring prior to successful renewal). Be careful with SAS start time. If you set the start time for a SAS to now, then due to clock skew (differences in current time according to different machines), failures may be observed intermittently for the first few minutes. In general, set the start time to be at least 15 minutes in the past. Or, don’t set it at all, which will make it valid immediately in all cases. The same generally applies to expiry time as well–remember that you may observe up to 15 minutes of clock skew in either direction on any request. For clients using a REST version prior to 2012-02-12, the maximum duration for a SAS that does not reference a stored access policy is 1 hour, and any policies specifying longer term than that will fail.\nBe specific with the resource to be accessed. A security best practice is to provide a user with the minimum required privileges. If a user only needs read access to a single entity, then grant them read access to that single entity, and not read/write/delete access to all entities. This also helps lessen the damage if a SAS is compromised because the SAS has less power in the hands of an attacker.\nUnderstand that your account will be billed for any usage, including that done with SAS. If you provide write access to a blob, a user may choose to upload a 200GB blob. If you’ve given them read access as well, they may choose to download it 10 times, incurring 2 TB in egress costs for you. Again, provide limited permissions to help mitigate the potential actions of malicious users. Use short-lived SAS to reduce this threat (but be mindful of clock skew on the end time).\nValidate data written using SAS. When a client application writes data to your storage account, keep in mind that there can be problems with that data. If your application requires that data be validated or authorized before it is ready to use, you should perform this validation after the data is written and before it is used by your application. This practice also protects against corrupt or malicious data being written to your account, either by a user who properly acquired the SAS, or by a user exploiting a leaked SAS.\nDon’t always use SAS. Sometimes the risks associated with a particular operation against your storage account outweigh the benefits of SAS. For such operations, create a middle-tier service that writes to your storage account after performing business rule validation, authentication, and auditing. Also, sometimes it’s simpler to manage access in other ways. For example, if you want to make all blobs in a container publicly readable, you can make the container Public, rather than providing a SAS to every client for access.\nUse Storage Analytics to monitor your application. You can use logging and metrics to observe any spike in authentication failures due to an outage in your SAS provider service or to the inadvertent removal of a stored access policy. See the Azure Storage Team Blog for additional information."

A resource will create a Identity in Azure AD * An Azure Role\nTherefore by giving a AD registered App the Managed Identity Role, when the app trys to connect Ad will give permission without the need for any auth flow credentials to be passed.\nManaged identities eradicate the need to manage credentials within your code. A components identity is lodged within Active Directory, and makes available a AD Token for other componets to consume. The AD token gives the consuming compoent access rights to the original resource.\nThere are two types of Mangaged Identities, System assigned and User assigned. System assigned identities are tied to the resource that creates them, so when the resource is deleted, so is the identity, whereas user assigned identities exist idependantly whithin AD and can be assign to several resources.\ne.g As in the example below. A User Assigned managed identity is created and both a Azure Function and Azure Sql Server share the identity."

    "text": "Description\nWeb file uploads within a company has been a neglected space for a while now, as any file the appears on a laptop or via email is scanned by the inbuild Anti Virus software, but with new projects opening up internal strorage to external entities via web portals we have to consider the fact that somone could upload a file containing a virus and we would be none the wiser. For us to write a Anti Virus scanning tool is out of the question, even employing a piece of opensource software is not advisable, as we have no idea how upto date the virus templates are, or even if they are valid.\nA solution would be to send any prospective file to a external third party who specialises in file scanning and verification. A possible solution is descibed below.\n\n\n\nA Solution\n\nA file is uploaded via a a Wb Upload tool.\nThe web application registers its interest in file upload statuses with the SignalR handler\nThe file is passed to the Document API\nThe Document API passes the document to a Third Party AV scanning company.\n\nBecause a document could contain more than one file, It could take the Third Party a while to scan the complete document, so they normally make use of a Webhook interface so they can asynchronously send back a response.\n\nThe Document API receives a response and posts a success or fail message to the Event Grid File Upload Topic.\nIf the AV response was a success the file is written to the blob storage.\n\nThe notification pattern of EventGrid Topic/ Azure Function / Azure SignalR is a standard pattern. There is also a pattern for securing webhooks, although webhooks are not loved by all."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A web application, also known as a web app, is a software application that runs on web browsers and is accessed over the internet. It is designed to provide interactive and dynamic functionality to users, like traditional desktop applications, but with the advantage of being platform-independent and accessible from any device with a web browser.\nWeb applications are typically built using web technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, which enable the creation of interactive user interfaces and the manipulation of data. The application’s logic is executed on the server and/or client side, depending on the architecture employed.\nWeb applications can vary widely in their complexity and functionality, ranging from simple websites with basic forms and interactivity to more advanced applications that involve complex data processing, real-time communication, and collaboration. Examples of web applications include online banking systems, social media platforms, e-commerce websites, project management tools, and web-based email clients.\nOne of the key advantages of web applications is their ability to deliver updates and improvements seamlessly, as they are centrally hosted and accessed over the internet. This eliminates the need for users to manually install software updates, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly experience.\n\n\nSSR (Server-Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation), SPA (Single-Page Application), PWA (Progressive Web Application), Isomorphic, and Micro Frontend architectures are different approaches to building web applications, each with its own characteristics and benefits.\n\n\nSSR is an approach where the server generates the complete HTML for each request and sends it to the client. The client receives a fully rendered page, including content and data. SSR is beneficial for improving initial page load time and search engine optimization (SEO) since search engines can easily crawl and index the content.\n\n\n\n\nSSG is a method of generating static HTML files during the build process based on predefined templates and data. These static files can then be served to clients without the need for server-side processing. SSG provides fast page loads, reduces server load, and enables caching benefits. It is well-suited for content-based websites and blogs with less dynamic content.\n\n\n\n\nSPA is an application that loads a single HTML page initially and then dynamically updates its content using JavaScript, typically through API calls. The client-side JavaScript handles the rendering of views and the manipulation of data. SPAs provide a smooth and responsive user experience, as they avoid full page reloads. Examples include Gmail and Trello.\n\n\n\n\nPWA is an application that combines the features of web and mobile apps. PWAs are built using web technologies and provide an app-like experience to users, including offline capabilities, push notifications, and access to device features. PWAs can be installed on the user’s device and are accessible through the home screen, bridging the gap between web and native apps.\n\n\n\n\nIsomorphic applications aim to create a consistent codebase that can run both on the server and the client. The goal is to share as much code as possible between the server and the client, enabling server-side rendering for improved initial load times and search engine friendliness while still providing interactive client-side functionality.\n\n\n\n\nMicro Frontend is an architectural approach that focuses on breaking down a web application into smaller, self-contained frontend modules. Each module can be developed, tested, and deployed independently, often by different teams. Micro Frontend allows for better scalability, flexibility, and autonomy in the frontend development process.\n\nIt’s important to note that these architectures are not mutually exclusive, and elements of each can be combined to suit specific project requirements. The choice of architecture depends on factors such as application complexity, performance needs, SEO requirements, development team structure, and user experience goals.\n\n\n\n\nThe web has got more complicated, having a development team that can keep pace with the development and testing approaches, code structures and framework evolutions is difficult and probably very expensive. Multiple teams, different focuses Having one team develop a web application where everyone uses one JavaScript framework for the GUI and .NET for the APIs can have several benefits: 1. Consistency: Using a single JavaScript framework for the GUI ensures consistent code style, architecture, and patterns across the frontend components. This simplifies collaboration, code reviews, and maintenance tasks within the development team. 2. Efficient Communication: When the GUI and APIs are developed by the same team, communication between frontend and backend developers becomes more seamless. Developers can coordinate closely, align requirements, and address issues promptly. 3. Shared Expertise: By focusing on a single JavaScript framework, team members can deepen their expertise in that particular framework. This can result in faster development, efficient problem-solving, and improved overall quality of the frontend code. 4. Seamless Integration: .NET is a versatile framework that offers excellent integration capabilities with various APIs and services. When the same team handles both the frontend and backend, they can ensure smooth communication and data flow between the GUI and the APIs, leading to a better overall user experience. 5. Faster Development Iterations: With a unified team and shared knowledge, development iterations can be accelerated. Developers can iterate and deploy changes more quickly, as they have a deep understanding of both the frontend and backend components. This agility can be beneficial for meeting project deadlines and adapting to evolving requirements. However, there are some considerations to keep in mind: 1. Expertise Balance: It’s important to ensure that the team has a balanced skill set, with expertise in both the chosen JavaScript framework and .NET for APIs. If the team members are primarily skilled in one area and lack proficiency in the other, it could lead to inefficiencies or a compromise in the quality of either the frontend or backend development. 2. Scalability: As the application grows and becomes more complex, a single team may face challenges in managing both the frontend and backend aspects simultaneously. In such cases, it may be necessary to divide the team or consider specialized roles to ensure efficient development and maintenance. 3. Flexibility and Adaptability: Relying on a single JavaScript framework and .NET for APIs may limit the team’s flexibility when it comes to incorporating new technologies or frameworks that may better suit specific requirements. It’s important to periodically evaluate and adapt the technology stack to stay up-to-date with industry trends and evolving project needs. Ultimately, the decision to have one team develop both the GUI and APIs using specific technologies depends on factors such as the team’s expertise, project requirements, timelines, and scalability considerations.\nIn Hub 1.0 we have encountered all the negative considerations detailed above, so I’d advise against having multi-disciplinary developers, rather we should have Web GUI and API developers who specialise in their areas."
