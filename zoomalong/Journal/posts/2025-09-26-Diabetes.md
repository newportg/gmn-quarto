Been trying for years to loose weight, but this summer I had to stop exercising as I had a sciatic nerve issue, twice, which took some time to recover from. So by september I'd lost 10 Kg, no big thing, over the a four month time period thats what all the diets aim for isnt it. So the doctor sent me for some blood tests and I went on holiday. My holiday was interrupted by calls from the GP to get in contact, which I did on return.

My HbA1C levels where at 106, normal levels are below 46 mmol/mol. So I'm diabetic :(

Now I have this !!
